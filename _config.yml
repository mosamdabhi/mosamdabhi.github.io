# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

# Using my background in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, I am interested in uncovering the causal reasoning to develop
# artifically intelligent (AI) systems that can "think", "reason", and "imagine" for themselves. Such an intelligence should hold the key to solve the problems of Out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) generalization, 
# lifelong learning via abstraction, and the problem of handling catastrophic forgetting, prevelant in modern AI methods.

PhD student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University with Simon Lucey and Laszlo Jeni. Before that, I worked with Nathan Michael at on making drones operate intelligently.

Solving spatial intelligence merging existing data streams on internet with spatial siganls (3D) to lead the base for artificial general intelligence (AGI).
  
# In my opinion: "AI could enable the creation of a versatile language through which all the existing scientific fields could be expressed."

# I am a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I investigate uncovering the representations that could be used as implicit priors and act as a placeholder for human visual intelligence.

# My goal is to understand how OOD reasoning (generalization) could be achieved to attain such general multi-modal intelligence in machines. To this end, I am currently focusing on extracting geometric reasoning via graph based representations to tackle this task.

# I am a PhD student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I investigate causality within machine learning, and geometrical priors within computer vision.

# Previously, I finished my Masters at CMU with Simon Lucey.
